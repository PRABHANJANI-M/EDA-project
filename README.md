# 📊 Bestsellers by Categories
# 📌 Overview

Businesses often deal with large datasets containing information about products, their categories, and sales performance. To make data-driven decisions, it’s important to identify which products are performing best in their respective categories.

This project provides a simple yet powerful way to analyze such datasets and determine bestselling items by category. By leveraging Python and Pandas, the program efficiently groups data, applies analysis, and presents the top-selling product in each category in a structured format.

The goal is to help in:

Understanding customer preferences.

Spotting top-performing items.

Providing actionable insights for business strategy.

# 🔍 Data Analysis

The dataset used typically contains the following columns:

Item → The product name (e.g., Atomic Habits, iPhone 15).

Category → The category of the product (e.g., Books, Electronics, Clothing).

Sales → The number of units sold or revenue generated.

# Steps in the Analysis:

Data Loading: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Grouping by Category: Split data into distinct categories (Books, Electronics, etc.).

Finding Bestsellers: Within each category, identify the product with the maximum sales.

Output Generation: Display a concise table showing the bestseller in each category.

This process allows quick filtering of the top-performing product per category, even in large datasets.

# ✨ Features

✅ Automatic Bestseller Detection: Identifies the top-selling product in each category.

✅ Category-wise Analysis: Works across multiple product categories.

✅ Scalable: Can handle datasets of any size (small to large).

✅ Readable Output: Results displayed in a clean, tabular format.

✅ Flexible Input: Works with CSV/Excel or even manually provided data.

✅ Extendable: Can be integrated with visualization libraries (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for deeper insights.

# 📊 Insights

From the analysis, businesses can obtain answers to questions like:

Which book sold the most?
